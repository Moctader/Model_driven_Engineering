Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) offers a robust framework for advancing financial forecasting by emphasizing abstraction, automation, and the systematic integration of models. In the long term, MDE can be utilized to create domain-specific languages (DSLs) tailored for financial modeling, allowing stakeholders to express complex forecasting requirements in a clear and structured manner. This will facilitate the generation of high-quality predictive models, ensuring that they are scalable, maintainable, and reusable across various financial contexts.

MDE can also streamline the integration of diverse data sources, enabling more accurate and comprehensive analyses of market trends and economic indicators. Furthermore, by automating the model transformation processes, MDE enhances the efficiency of deploying predictive analytics in real-time financial systems, supporting proactive decision-making.

Ultimately, adopting MDE in financial forecasting can lead to the establishment of standardized methodologies, improved collaboration among financial analysts, data scientists, and software engineers, and a greater emphasis on responsible and ethical forecasting practices. This comprehensive approach will not only enhance the accuracy and reliability of financial forecasts but also contribute to the development of adaptive systems that respond dynamically to changing economic conditions.
